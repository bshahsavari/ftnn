\section{Introduction}

\par Macroscopic freeway traffic models are widely used by transportation engineers in order to design controllers and perform re-routing or road management to improve performance of the system; {\color{red} ??} for instance, increasing total traveled distance and decreasing total travel time of vehicles in the network. A crucial component of this process of traffic management is simulation of traffic behavior which is usually accomplished using traditional simulators where system's behavior is predicted by  {\color{red}{some hand-engineered }} dynamics assumed to govern evolution of traffic.

The burdensome aspect of traffic prediction is that traffic condition is contingent on too many different parameters. For instance, for a given network, the day for which the simulation is required, plays a significant role as traffic regime on weekends varies from the one on workdays. Furthermore, for a particular day, clearly, vehicular traffic in evening differs from the one at midnight. Thus, a decent traffic prediction must incorporate distinct parameters influencing traffic conditions. {\color{red}{We also need to explain the prediction part of the project + our main contributions}}

\subsection{Motivation}

As every watchful motorist driving in California freeways can recognize, there are numerous implemented loop detectors {\color{red}{Figure}} in freeway stretches of California that measure and record traffic metrics. These sensors provide traffic data-centers with huge amount of information that must be taken into account while making predictions. The immense existing data and complexity of traffic behavior as a result of being affected by different continuous and discrete parameters, motivated the authors to perform traffic prediction deploying neural network and deep learning methods to come up with a traffic simulation which can possibly perform better than the existing traffic simulators\cite{neuralForcast} {\color{red}{we need to separate simulation from prediction}}. 

\subsection{PeMS Data} 
PeMS (Performance Measurement System) is a traffic metrics measurement system all over California deployed to obtain loop detector data in real time \cite{PemsPravin}. Freeway PeMS raw data consists of measurements of vehicular flow, occupancy (fraction of time a vehicle is present on the loop detector) and speed in time intervals of $5$ minutes. PeMS data is available to users at \url{http://pems.dot.ca.gov/}. In this project, PeMS data of freeway I-210-East in the southern California area (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:210})  was used to generate training, validation and test data sets.

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\subsection{Training Data}
As mentioned previously, since traffic behavior is highly dependent on time of the day and date, our training data consists of 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Flow:\textcolor{red}{description}
\item Occupancy:\textcolor{red}{description}
\item Speed:\textcolor{red}{description}
\item Date :\textcolor{red}{description}
\item Time of day :\textcolor{red}{description}
\end{enumerate}for a single VDS (vehicle detection station) of I-210. Each day is divided into 288 intervals where each time interval lasts $5$ minutes. This data was collected for the last three months of 2014 (October 1\textsuperscript{st} to December 31\textsuperscript{st}).

\subsection{Training Method}
Our main focus of data training was obtaining one-step prediction of traffic behavior; in other words, giving the features of a particular time step of a specific day as the inputs, the outputs should be flow, speed and occupancy of the considered VDS in the next time step. In order to get such a prediction function, a multi-layer neural network was trained on the data, whose characteristics such as number of hidden nodes, activation functions and number of hidden layers were obtained by cross-validation over a range of node numbers, activation function types and number of layers.
